Since September 2024, I have been serving as an Assistant Professor at the University of Cádiz, Spain, within the Department of Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Design, specializing in Engineering Projects. I am also a member of the research team TEP 143 "Termotecnia."

My research focuses on adaptive thermal comfort, energy efficiency, energy poverty, and the impacts of climate change. To date, I have co-authored over 25 peer-reviewed publications indexed in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR), with a current h-index of 16 and 575 citations according to Scopus. My doctoral thesis, titled "Development of a Building Energy Model Based on Adaptive Comfort Algorithms under the Influence of Climate Change: Adaptive-Comfort-Control-Implemented Model (ACCIM)," introduced an innovative paradigm shift by replacing conventional setpoint temperatures with adaptive comfort-based setpoints, moving away from the traditional Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) index. This work has been extensively published, featuring international collaborations with experts in thermal comfort such as Jesús Alberto Pulido-Arcas (University of Tokyo), Alexis Pérez-Fargallo (University of San Sebastián, Chile), Ricardo Forgiarini Rupp (Technical University of Denmark), and Richard de Dear (University of Sydney).

To facilitate the implementation of adaptive setpoint temperatures in EnergyPlus building energy models, I developed a Python package called "accim," for which I was awarded the 2022 CIBSE Building Simulation Award.

I have also been involved in multiple national and international research projects, including the Energy Poverty Intelligence Unit (EPIU), as well as research networks such as the “Red Iberoamericana de Pobreza Energética y Bienestar Ambiental (RIPEBA).”
